# ArtiGAN
Our Project generates Monet-style images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consisting of a generator and discriminator neural network. Also, It contains some additional features like Chatbot which tells you about what actually Monet-style images are, along with feature of Object Detection for generating its images using GAN architecture.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project aims to build a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can generate a large number of Monet-style images. The problem statement is that there is a need for a large dataset of Monet-style images for research, training, or other purposes, but such a dataset does not currently exist.

The proposed solution is to use GANs, a type of machine learning algorithm, to generate Monet-style images that are visually similar to the famous impressionist painter Claude Monet's paintings. A GAN consists of two parts: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to create images that resemble the training data (in this case, Monet's paintings), while the discriminator learns to distinguish between the generated images and real images.

By training the GAN on a dataset of Monet's paintings, the generator can learn to produce new images that have similar style, color, and texture to the original paintings. The goal is to generate a large number of images, ranging from 7,000 to 10,000, that can be used for various purposes, such as art generation, image manipulation, or computer vision research.
